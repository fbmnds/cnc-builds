* CNC-Builds
A library for 2.5D CNC.

** Concepts
- A *XY*-coordinate is represented as ~(X . Y)~.
- A *XYZ*-coordinate is represented as ~((X . Y) . Z)~.
- A *PATH* is a ~LIST~ of =absolute= *XY*-/*XYZ*-coordinates. *INNER* and *OUTER* pths are derived from an *XY* path by applying an offset of radius *R* to it, which corresponds to the radius of the CNC end mill.
- A *PATH SEGMENT* is a ~CONS~ of =absolute= *XY*-/*XYZ*-coordinates.
- A *TAG* is a *PATH SEGMENT*, where a *TAP*, i.e. a path gap in *Z* direction, shall be located in the milling path.
- A *TICK* is a tiny *PATH SEGMENT* pair that pushed forth and back into a *XY* corner.The purpose of a *TICK* is to avoid manual post-processing of a milled piece. They are currently only implemented for 90‚Å∞ *XY* aligned corners.

Generated GCode is intentionally reduduced to =linear=, =incremental= segments. Curvatures are handled by means of pre-processing with the tools of this library.
  
** Usage

#+begin_src common-lisp

  (require :asdf)
  (asdf:load-asd "/home/dev/projects/cnc-builds/cnc-builds.asd")
  (asdf:load-system :cnc-builds)

  ;; basic regression tests
  (paths/box-tests:run-tests)

  ;; visual regression tests
  (paths/box-tests:run-view-tests)

#+end_src

~run-view-tests~ covers main *XY* paths configurations, among them:
- Layout of a fingerjointed box
  [[./doc/tbox-outline.png]]
- Ticked outline of a fingerjoint face
  [[./doc/ticked-outline.png]]
- A closed spiral, e.g. for pockets
  [[./doc/closed-spiral.png]]
- A filled rectangle, e.g. for surface planing
  [[./doc/filled-rectangle.png]]

** Generate GCode

~emitt-gcode-xy-z~ takes a list of =incremental= *XYZ* coordinates, for which the GCode is generated with speed settings *F* for *XY* and *FZ* for *Z* directions.

~convert-path-dxyz%~ generates the list of =incremental= *XYZ* coordinates considering taps. Its internals do not allow for integrating *TICK*s, for which it was deprecated.

#+begin_src common-lisp

  (in-package paths/emitt)

  (defparameter path (car paths/box-tests::tbox))
  (defparameter tags
    (remove-if #'(lambda (c) (< (euklid (c- (car c) (cdr c))) 6.)) (group-2 path)))

  (with-open-file (f "~/share/test2.nc"
                     :direction :output :if-exists :supersede)
    (format f "G21~%G91~%")
    (dolist (ln (emitt-gcode-xy-z
                 (convert-path-dxyz% path tags 1. -1. 5) -0.5 1200))
      (format f "~a~%" ln)))

The correctness of the generated GCode may e.g. verified with the visualizer of the *Universal GCode Sender*:

[[./doc/convert-path-dxyz%25.png]]

The *TAP*s are visible e.g. right below of the yellow cone and at the "4mm" marking.
